**Abstract**: Many blame today's economic inequality, stagnation, and political instability on the free market. The solution is to rein in the market, right? Radical Markets turns this thinking--and pretty much all conventional thinking about markets, both for and against—on its head. The book reveals bold new ways to organize markets for the good of everyone. It shows how the emancipatory force of genuinely open, free, and competitive markets can reawaken the dormant nineteenth-century spirit of liberal reform and lead to greater equality, prosperity, and cooperation.

Eric Posner and Glen Weyl demonstrate why private property is inherently monopolistic, and how we would all be better off if private ownership were converted into a public auction for public benefit. They show how the principle of one person, one vote inhibits democracy, suggesting instead an ingenious way for voters to effectively influence the issues that matter most to them. They argue that every citizen of a host country should benefit from immigration—not just migrants and their capitalist employers. They propose leveraging antitrust laws to liberate markets from the grip of institutional investors and creating a data labor movement to force digital monopolies to compensate people for their electronic data.

The Becker Friedman Institute (BFI) invites you to a special conference event to explore Radical Markets: Uprooting Capitalism and Democracy for a Just Society, a new book by Eric Posner of the University of Chicago Law School, and Glen Weyl of Microsoft Research New England. A diverse group of University of Chicago scholars, including Steve Levitt, Karin Knorr, Andrew Chien, and Jennifer Pitts, will discuss Posner & Weyl’s vision. In Radical Markets, the authors sketch a path to prosperity, inclusion and justice through radically rethinking property, representation, and association, leveraging increased competition and decentralized information, and unleashing emerging technologies from the Internet to big data and AI.

This event is co-sponsorship by Knowledge Lab & Computational Social Science program.
